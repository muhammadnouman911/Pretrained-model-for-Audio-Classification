## üåê **How to Use**:

1. **Load the Model**:

   * Example for VGgish:

   ```python
   from VGgish_Model import VGgish
   model = VGgish.load_model()
   ```

   * Example for YAMNet:

   ```python
   from YAMNet_Model import YAMNet
   model = YAMNet.load_model()
   ```

2. **Upload Audio**: You can upload your own audio files and start classifying. The notebooks have detailed code to help with this process.

3. **Explore and Fine-Tune**: The models can be fine-tuned for specific audio datasets or used directly for classification tasks.
